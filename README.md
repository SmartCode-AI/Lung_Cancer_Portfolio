# Lung Cancer Prediction AI

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In many communities, especially in rural areas, hospitals do not have enough doctors or medical tools to diagnose it quickly. This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to help predict whether 
a person is at risk of lung cancer based on medical and lifestyle information. 

The AI uses a dataset (CSV file) with 16 attributes and 284 patient records to analyze patterns and make predictions whether a person is most likely to have lung cancer or not.

**Objectives**

1, Detect lung cancer early using AI.  
2, Make screening possible in areas with few medical resources.  
3, Reduce hospital delays and costs.  
4, Support better health planning.  

**Tools & Libraries**

1, Python – Programming language  
2, Scikit-learn – Machine learning models  
3, Pandas, NumPy – Data handling  
4, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization  

**Machine Learning Models**

Naïve Bayes (Gaussian), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Decision Tree 
Random Forest and 
Single Variable Regressor

**Dataset**

284 records, 16 attributes  
Attributes include: _Gender, Age, Smoking, Yellow Fingers, Anxiety, Peer Pressure, Chronic Disease, Fatigue, Wheezing, Alcohol Consumption, Coughing, Shortness of Breath, Swallowing Difficulty, Chest Pain, and Lung Cancer (target)_.
